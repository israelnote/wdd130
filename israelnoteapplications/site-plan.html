        The company was founded in 2023 by the company's CEO Israel dos Santos Silva. He was majoring in computer science at Brigham Young University Idaho when he got the idea to offer his services as a developer to his friends, family and neighbors. Things started to work out, so he started visiting small businesses in the city where he lived. He realized that many small businesses didn't want or didn't know how to increase their visibility in the internet world. That's how the idea of ​​creating your own software development company was born.
