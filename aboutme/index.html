    <p>Hello Guys! Let me introduce myself. I'm married with a beautiful girl. I have 34 years old and
    I have 3 daughters. They have 10, 7 and 5 years old each one. I'm from Maracanau, Brazil, a city next to Fortaleza</p>
    <p>I had been a member of the church since my 16 age. When I was 19, I had the oportunity to serve a mission.
    I served for two years in the Brazil Ribeir√£o Preto Mission. This time was a blessing in my life. I learned a lot.</p>
    <p>Currently, I work in a hospital as an administrative assistent. In my day off, I like to stay with my family watching movies and I like to play guitar.</p>
    <p>I am a student from BYU Idaho. I pursue a bachelor degree in software development. I love technology and I make a graduation in Brazil in the Descomplica Universty.
    I'm so excited to learn with our teacher and my classmates. Thank you for looking my web page.
    </p>
